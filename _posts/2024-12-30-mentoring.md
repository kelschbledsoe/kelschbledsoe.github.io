## Context

With 2025 right around the corner, the topics of yearly goals and New Year's Resolutions are on the front of my mind. I've personally never been a fan of yearly goals. I've found that my life is too fluid and unpredictable for that. Instead, I do themes and quarterly-checkins. 

The theme that kept popping up for me throughout 2023 and 2024 was _bleh_. I felt _bleh_ about my life. And the frustrating part of this was that _I didn't know why_. No aspect of my life was more stressful or unfulfilling than in the past... but it felt like something was missing. I wasn't depressed, but I was missing my _sparkle_ for lack of a better term. And as I thought more about this _bleh_, I realized that it had lingered, like a dull headache, since my senior year of college, which I had attributed to having graduated during the pandemic aka _the panini press_. Seeing friends, traveling, and living the average life of a 20-something would push away this feeling, but it always crept back.

Even as I write this, I'm unsure if there's a singular cause for the general _bleh_ I felt for so long. But direct symptoms of it were frustration in my work, disinterest in the tech industry, and a feeling of being directionless. I didn't know what I was doing with my life or why, and the general advice of "you're in your 20s, you aren't supposed to know" didn't settle with me.

The first thing I tried was diving back into hobbies and interests. As a neurodivergent "gifted" kid, many of my interests growing up were discouraged or deprioritized in favor of academics. I fulfilled a childhood dream of building a gaming PC to start streaming. I combed through resources and research papers online to develop a custom physical therapy routine for my numerous lingering injuries from a lifetime of being a student-athlete so I could play basketball again with my younger brother. I traveled a lot, even solo traveled to Ireland. I did even more self-learning in personal finance. I built a side-hustle that is arguably a small business. Even this blog is one of these interests! 

But the theme with all of these is that **they have nothing to do with tech**. And if you're in the tech industry, you know it's a rat race, especially in the current job market. If you aren't learning, tinkering, and exploring, you're falling behind. Personally, I think this culture is toxic and feeds the already chronic issues of burnout and exclusivity in our industry, but I won't hop on that soap box.

I found this realization even more troubling. I thoroughly enjoyed my coursework in college. I wanted to want to learn. But I had a mental blockade I couldn't get over.
- I struggled to find a topic I wanted to learn about
- I struggled to find a project I wanted to experiment with
- I struggled to have a clear mind when debugging any problems
- I struggled to retain information between sessions
- I struggled to have the confidence to believe I could learn or create something new
This mental blockade seeped into my full-time work as well. I thought I had long covid. Or that I wasn't cut out for the tech industry. But this mental blockade was my _bleh_. **Finding the problem is half the battle**.

As a former academic weapon, I felt that going back to my roots would help with this mental blockade.
- I enrolled in online learning courses through Cisco and LinkedIn
- I explored topics on TryHackMe
- I got involved in local tech groups like WiSKC and SecKC
- I got my Security+ certification
**None of these fixed my mental blockade**.

## Enter the highschoolers

Think of life like a barrel of monkeys. Someday, you'll be lucky and a kind soul will help lift you out of the barrel. They can do this by giving you a job referral, offering to do a mock interview, giving resume advice, speaking at a conference or group meetup, or just offering words of encouragement. They take a chance on you. Make sure that as you're being pulled out of the barrel that you pull someone up with you!

I benefitted **immensely** throughout college and my career by kind people who were willing to lift me out of the barrel. I'm sure that as you read this, you can think of 5 people who have done that for you. I wanted to keep the chain going by mentoring a local high school group, specifically through Girls Who Code and CyberPatriots. Now, I know what you're thinking... "Gabby, you voluntarily spend your freetime with teenagers?" Yes. And it was one of the best decisions I've made in the last several years, because it fixed my mental blockade.

## Energy is contagious
Both good vibes and bad vibes spread like wildfire. The tech industry, especially cybersecurity, can easily be dominated by _bad vibes_. Deadlines, breaches, red tape, on-call hours... this is why who you work with and for is vitally important. 

A group of high school nerds is full of _good vibes_. This is their safe space, where they can be themselves with their friends. They're excited to be there, they're excited to have an adult who understands the "real world" (more on that later), and they're excited to learn "useful" things! No matter what was going on in my life, their energy lifted me up. These _good vibes_ were critical in getting out of my funk. It allowed me to have a clear mind and calm energy when approaching any problems.

## You're the expert now
As the designated adult who understands the "real world", I get asked a lot of random technical questions. 
- Do you know anything about AI?
- Do you know anything about Rust? 
- Can you troubleshoot these Raspberry Pi 3s that have sat in a corner collecting dust for years? 
- Can you configure a VM to run Mint 21 and guide a student to do some basic device management on it? 
The answer to all of that is... _maybe_. But just reflecting on these interactions gives me that _sparkle_ I was missing. Here are the **topics** and **projects**, figure it out. Somehow, a switch flipped in my brain, and suddenly I didn't have a mental blockade for these projects. I had the confidence to believe I had a decent shot at figuring these things out, at least to a level that a high schooler would understand and be able to continue their own self-discovery on the topic.

## The world is their oyster... and you're the fisherman!
What do you wish you would have known in high school? What do you wish you could tell teenage you? Well, now here is your opportunity, only the kids are more stressed, more self-aware, and more talented than you ever were!
No seriously, some of these kids are way smarter than me, and I'm a fairly smart cookie.
By recognizing the role I play in this pivotal stage of these young adults, I was able to do a lot of self-reflection on my own academic journey.
- I had minimal to no guidance on applying to college, understanding financial aid, and choosing a college
- I changed my major to Computer Science on a whim, and was very behind my peers in prior knowledge, which heavily fed my imposter syndrome
- A common narrative is "your coursework isn't enough to land a job!" yet I struggled to parse through what I should be learning
- I realized that while I could learn said important topics via YouTube University, it wouldn't be until later in my career that I could discern between having learned a hackjob or best practices

This immensely helped clear the mental blockade as well. As an example, I alluded to some Raspberry Pis. Hardware is a topic that has always elluded me, but something I always avoided due to being overwhelmed by how much I didn't understand of the topic. There was also the financial barrier to entry back when I was in college. However, there's no better way to learn a material than by needing to teach it. I wanted to learn more about the Pis and experiment with them, to then **teach the students** about them, because I had always heard of how powerful and versatile they were. I wanted them to have this knowledge and tool at their disposal, especially because I didn't. Now, after having completed that project, I'm looking to get more experience with networking, specifically hands-on experience. Studying the OSI model and tinkering with Packet Tracer hasn't helped me understand networking as much as I'd like to, so I believe physically getting my hands on some equipment will make things finally click.

Passing along other tidbits of knowledge like evaluating colleges, judging degree curriculum, and identifying helpful online learning resources, has been a very rewarding experience. It's fulfilling giving the students another perspective on a topic and challenging them to approach a problem from another angle.

## What's next for Gabby?
While mentoring the high school group has lifted a weight off of me, I still have more growth to do. I feel as though I'm at a crossroads in life right now. The metaphorical roads are shrouded in fog. It won't be until later into 2025 that I'm able to peer down those paths and pick which feels right for my journey.

As for the students, I have some lofty goals for spring semester. I'd like to chaperone some more trips for them. I'm eyeing a site visit to an incident response team, attending BSidesKC, and another programming competition. Also, I was able to secure additional funding for the students to compete in the National Cyber League CTF. I'm also cooking up a networking lab to host at some point. I'm looking to use this blog to document these adventures and any other knowledge I deem may be worth throwing out onto the internet!

## I related to this post - how do I get into mentoring someone?
Awesome!!

There is no singular way to start mentoring someone. A couple options:
- Check your local professional development group. SecKC has a mentorship program I participate in. In college, our Women in Engineering group's mentorship program was critical in my ability to succeed in my major and make friends.
- Look into nearby non-profits. On the Girls Who Code website, you can search for chapters in your area, and it'll list contact information and if the group is looking for a mentor. The CyberPatriots website has a similar setup to connect teams with technical mentors.
- Think about your own network. Maybe your neighbor's kid is interested in tech. 

If you read this far, thank you! I hope you found this helpful. Happy New Years!

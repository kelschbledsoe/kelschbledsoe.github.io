Hello and welcome to my blog!

I am a Cybersecurity Professional focused on vulnerability management and automation. I'm based out of Kansas City, MO, but my team is primarily located in Plymouth, UK and my employer is based in Karlskrona, Sweden.

I have worked in many different companies, industries, roles, and languages, with each opportunity teaching me valuable lessons about myself and the tech industry. Currently, my work is primarily in Python and PowerBI reporting.

My technical interests include secure software development, automation, and increasing the accessibility of tech and tech careers.

My passions outside of work include traveling, basketball, Michigan State Univeristy (Go Green!), and personal finance.

Reach out to me via email kelschbledsoe(at)gmail(dot)com for any employment or speaking opportunities!
